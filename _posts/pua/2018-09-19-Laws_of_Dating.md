* Stop making identity meaning out of external events.
* See yourself as "high status."
  * 用很少话讲清楚地事情
  * 面对社交价值比你高的时候，我们需要他们的认可，我们的回答是完整严密。同理如果你想要高的社交价值，就不要：`问题的回答过于完美完整`
    * 转换话题: 
    * 用冷读岔开话题，夺回控制权:`我觉得你刚才问我问题的样子很可爱。`
    * `除非给你回话，也就是有反馈，，否则就不要说太多。在实战中，你可以用休止谈话法和故意制造尴尬沉默法来迫使对方做出反馈，给你回话。`
  * 去掉小动作
  * 肩膀不要绷得太紧。要面带笑容
  * 讲话语速要慢
  * 去掉习惯性口头语
  * 讲笑话的时候，切记自己不要先笑
  * 用男人底气十足的语气开玩笑地说，`"你刚才说的我一个字都没听清楚（看着她，沉默几秒钟）。。。。。但是，你刚才讲话的样子很可爱。"`加上坏笑，整个时候你都深深地看着她的眼睛，同时记住讲话要稳，要慢。你自己吐字发音要清楚。



  * Don't try to control her by supporting her or giving her money.
  * Stop trying to impress women.
  * Behave as if you have 100 women calling you every day.
  * Make friends with attractive women by becoming a guy that women like to be around.
  * Always act and communicate in a way that leaves her wanting to know more, feel more and do more.----让其保存好奇心

* Prove to yourself over and over that you can deal with "rejection."

  * When you find yourself losing a woman, stop, step back and wait until she comes to you - pull the needle out of your arm immediately.-----避免纠缠，你是能接受被拒绝的

* Learn to identify social status by communication and body language instantly.

  * Learn how to read situations before acting or communicating.
